# Building forms and validation

In this post I'll be detailing how I approached form state management and validation for a side-project of mine, [Urban Jungle](https://github.com/josephluck/urban-jungle).

Typically in side projects, I like identify problems and solve them in novel ways, ways that I would not usually have the fortune to explore in my professional day job as a software engineer. Often by exploring new solutions, I further my understanding of the problem in a way that generalises to solutions I _do_ need to explore in my day to day.

## What's the problem we're solving?

Urban Jungle doesn't have _that many_ forms, however I wanted to build an abstraction in React that would allow me to define a data schema in TypeScript and to be able to build state management and validation on top of that well-defined schema in a way that afforded great editor auto completion and full type safety.

I also wanted a clear separation of concerns, i.e. I didn't want to litter my business logic with form state management too much (though the abstraction should allow the consumer to manually change values and internal state where required) - for that reason I wanted a separate library to deal with form state management that I could use independently from the rest of the logic of the feature.

I also explored a purely functional and strongly typed approach with Urban Jungle and leveraged the amazing [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library for the app, and for the form library. Apologies if you're not massively familiar with fp-ts or functional programming in general, I hope that the ideas I'm showing here will have merit irrespective of the actual implementation.

## What does it look like?

Whenever I build an abstraction like this, I always list out the requirements and then sketch out what the external API should look like. Usually I'll go through a few iterations before settling on the final API, and I do this inside my editor before I implement the internals.

That's more than enough talk - here's a quick video showcasing what it's like to use of the library to build a form:

<Video src="/use-form/use-form-usage.mp4" />

And here's the code:

```typescript
type Fields = {
  name: string;
  nickname: string;
  location: string;
  avatar: ImageModel;
};

type ImageModel = {
  uri: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
};

const {
  submit,
  registerTextInput,
  registerSinglePickerInput,
  registerCameraField,
} = useForm<Fields>(
  {
    name: "",
    nickname: "",
    location: "",
    avatar: {
      uri: "",
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
  },
  {
    name: [constraints.isRequired, constraints.alphaNumeric],
    nickname: [constraints.atLeastLength(5)],
    location: [],
    avatar: [constraints.isValidImageModel],
  }
);

const onSubmit = () => {
  pipe(
    TE.fromEither(submit()),
    TE.chain((values) => save(values))
  );
};

return (
  <FormContainer onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <TextField label="Name" {...registerTextInput("name")} />
    <TextField label="Nickname" {...registerTextInput("nickname")} />
    <PickerField
      label="Location"
      multiValue={false}
      options={locations.map((value) => ({
        value,
        label: location,
      }))}
      {...registerSinglePickerInput("location")}
    />
    <CameraField
      label="Picture"
      type="plant"
      {...registerCameraField("avatar")}
    />
  </FormContainer>
);
```

Here's the same code with inline comments explaining a few bits and pieces:

```typescript
// we'll define a schema of our form fields as a simple object type
type Fields = {
  name: string; // a simple scalar value
  nickname: string;
  location: string;
  avatar: ImageModel; // application-specific data types should be supported too, i.e. we'll have a CameraField component that produces an `ImageModel`.
};

type ImageModel = {
  uri: string;
  width: number;
  height: number;
};

const {
  submit, // submit should run the validation and let the caller know whether everything's valid or not
  registerTextInput, // a function that binds a text field to the form. Provides state management for the field as well as error, touched state and any other information the field needs. MUST be strongly typed to the schema i.e. registerTextInput('name') works, but 'nameee' and 'avatar' throw compile time errors.
  registerSinglePickerInput,
  registerCameraField, // only keys in the schema that match the camera field's value requirements can be registered, i.e. registerCameraField('avatar') will work, whereas 'location' will not.
} = useForm<Fields>(
  // the first argument will be the default values for the form
  {
    name: "",
    nickname: "",
    location: "",
    avatar: {
      uri: "",
      width: 0,
      height: 0,
    },
  },
  // the second argument will be our validation constraints for each field. We'll use Valley to actually implement validation: https://github.com/josephluck/valley
  {
    name: [constraints.isRequired, constraints.alphaNumeric], // multiple constraints are supported
    nickname: [constraints.atLeastLength(5)],
    location: [], // optional fields are supported
    avatar: [constraints.isValidImageModel],
  }
);

const onSubmit = () => {
  // validation uses fp-ts
  pipe(
    TE.fromEither(submit()),
    TE.chain((values) => save(values)) // submit returns the values of the form for ergonomics
  );
};

return (
  <FormContainer onSubmit={onSubmit}>
    <TextField label="Name" {...registerTextInput("name")} />
    <TextField label="Nickname" {...registerTextInput("nickname")} />
    <PickerField
      label="Location"
      multiValue={false}
      options={locations.map((value) => ({
        value,
        label: location,
      }))}
      {...registerSinglePickerInput("location")}
    />
    <CameraField
      label="Picture"
      type="plant"
      {...registerCameraField("avatar")}
    />
  </FormContainer>
);
```

There are a few key things I would like to point out about the libraries use:

**Type safety**

I focused on ensuring that the `useForm` hook is _fully_ type safe. And I don't just mean that `useForm` returns type safe functions and values (i.e. `type RegisterTextInput = (key: string) => TextFieldProps`), but rather the type system _knows about the schema passed to the hook_ (i.e. `type RegisterTextInput = (key: StringKeys<Fields>) => TextFieldProps`).

I'm a strong believer that leveraging the type system to this extent greatly reduces the number of bugs and inconsistencies that build up over time in a code base in addition to allowing for much easier and safer refactoring, as well as serving as a form of documentation for developers - not to mention the editor autocompletion which we'll get to later on.

Here's an example of a type error when using an incompatible key when registering a field:

<Image src="/use-form/invalid-registration.png" width={2852} height={386} />

> `registerCameraField` knows the keys in the schema that are of the type that `<CameraField />` accepts.

**Developer experience**

With everything I build, I strive to deliver the best developer experience I can. There are many different and important things that make for a great developer experience, however one that I find incredibly useful is to leverage TypeScript's ability to provide editor auto completion for domain specific types. I stove to implement `useForm` leveraging strong types as much as possible, to help with editor autocompletion.

Here's a couple of examples of editor autocompletion when registering a image fields:

<Image src="/use-form/editor-autocompletion.png" width={1102} height={254} />

> Because `useForm` is so strongly typed, vscode gives us a choice of keys that are compatible for registration with the `<CameraField />`

And another example for string fields:

<Image
  src="/use-form/editor-autocompletion-string.png"
  width={2578}
  height={466}
/>

> Similarly, vscode gives us a choice of keys that are compatible for registration with the `<TextField />`

**Separation of concerns**

The form state management (and validation) are grouped together in a single concern and is managed independently from the UI components. As an example, the `<TextField />` has no knowledge of the internal workings of the library, all it cares about is receiving a value and letting the parent component know when the value changes (as well as displaying error messages). This separation of concerns means that the form state management and the `<TextField />` component can change independently, as they have no direct dependency on one another (other than the facility to spread props over a field component to "register" register it, however this is simply a useful ergonomic shortcut, not a core part of the library).

In addition, the form state management and validation are completely separate to the business logic of what happens when the data is actually used (i.e. what happens when the form is submitted). The library provides a `submit` function that simply runs validation and provides the current values of the form fields, but it does not actually do anything with the data, not does it provide loading states or anything else. It's intentionally scoped to manage form state and validation really well and nothing more.

**Constraints**

The final thing I would like to point out is that not only are the fields themselves fully type safe to the schema, but the constraints are too.

The library uses [Valley](https://github.com/josephluck/valley) (a validation library I wrote) for it's validation, which expects strongly-typed constraint functions. These strong types are fed through from the schema such that it's only permitted by the compiler to provide string constraints for a schema key whose value a string.

I find this to be a really important part of both the developer experience and the safety afforded by the library as it allows the developer to be confident that they are configuring their form correctly by ensuring that only compatible constraints are permitted be used against the strongly typed schema.

Here's an example of the type error when using an incompatible number constraint against a string field:

<Image src="/use-form/invalid-constraint.png" width={3088} height={764} />

> The library enforces the constraints for the schema to be compatible with the schema's values. Here we see a compile time error because we've uses a constraint that operates on numbers against the `name` key in the schema, which is a string - only string constraints are permitted.

```

### How the types work

The first thing I'd like to pull out is how the type safety works from the schema. You'll notice that there's a generic type argument to `useForm` which is constrained to a `Record<string, any>` type. This constraint ensures that the form hook only manages objects. The generic type argument can be inferred from the initial data argument, but it's advised to manually provide an explicit type.

Built up from the generic type, additional types are created such as `type StringKeys`, `type NumberKeys`, `type MultiPickerKeys` and `type CameraKeys`. These additional types are used in the registration functions to strongly type the name of the field that should be registered according to compatible keys in the schema.

## Registration functions

One thing I quite like about this library is the ease in which you can bind values, callbacks, error states etc to a component. For example, `<TextField {...registerTextInput('name')} />` is all you need.

The registration functions are typed to take a key from the schema that matches the type of input, aka, `string` for `<TextField />` components via `registerTextInput()`, `number` for `<NumberField />` components (via `registerNumberInput()`), etc. The registration functions return an object of props that the respective component uses. In the libraries implementation, you'll notice the prop types are imported and are the return types of the registration functions.

One of the great aspects of the registration functions is that if the requirements of the field component change, the compiler will let us know and we can ensure that the form state management conforms to what the components are expecting.

Unfortunately, as the requirements for these registration functions are heavily dependent on the prop requirements of custom components, it's not viable to open source the library.

## Validation

You'll notice a `doValidate` function that uses Valley's `makeValidator` factory function. Valley is a validation library I made (that I wanted to use for Urban Jungle), however it would be trivial to swap out Valley for another validation library. `yup` would make a good replacement.

I chose to use Valley as it implements `fp-ts` compatible validation constraints requirements using `Either` and `TaskEither` which Urban Jungle uses heavily for controlling business logic in a pure and functional way.

The bulk of the validation logic resides in the `validate` function which simply calls `doValidate` and sets errors in the state (if there are any).

# Wrapping up

I hope this article has shown you the way I think about abstracting things away by prioritising developer experience, type safety and maintainability of the outside use.
