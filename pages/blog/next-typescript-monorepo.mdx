# Creating a Next.js mono repository project with TypeScript

In this post, we'll be exploring how to set up a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) mono repository project taking advantage of both [yarn workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

We'll set up a simple blog project from scratch, consisting of an application workspace, an API workspace and a shared component library workspace. The goal is to be able to make source file changes in one workspace that hot-reloads in other running workspaces without having to run any manual build tasks, pull from npm, github or otherwise.

This post assumes you're already familiar with npm, TypeScript, Next.js and React. It's lengthy, so grab a coffee and a fresh terminal.

#### TLDR?

If you prefer to jump straight in to the code, you can visit the [example repository](https://github.com/josephluck/next-typescript-monorepo) that accompanies this post.

---

## Some explanations

#### Why a mono repository?

A mono repository project structure is a popular choice for projects that benefit from sharing code such as open-source projects that publish many libraries from the same codebase such as [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) or products that have many deployable applications like [Spectrum](https://github.com/withspectrum/spectrum) does.

#### Next.js

This post focusses specifically on Next.js since it's a popular opinionated framework that users have [expressed](https://spectrum.chat/next-js/general/getting-next-js-to-see-shared-code-in-yarn-monorepo~8e47a82a-26c1-48fb-804d-77dfc02a2286) some [difficulty](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/issues/5666), [confusion](https://spectrum.chat/?t=a17d1fe1-9fb8-4d99-b6c1-53e2a3ee4b83) and [troubles](https://spectrum.chat/?t=e15a129c-5471-4c43-b417-d244a165ee0d) using with a mono repository set up.

Since Next.js is fairly opinionated it is tricky pairing it with other libraries and project-specific configuration, particularly within a mono repository set up.

#### TypeScript

Although certainly not a requirement for mono repository projects, TypeScript is a great tool and there are some specific configurations needed to get TypeScript to work well with a mono repository and Next.js.

---

## Setting things up

We'll be using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) as our dependency management tool and task runner. If you don't already have it, you can install it using npm:

```bash
npm i -g yarn
```

> You may need to use `sudo` if you get a permission error

Go ahead and create a new directory for the mono repository:

```bash
mkdir acme
cd acme
```

> Acme is the name of the company for the purposes of this post. Feel free to name this whatever you like!

Initialize the mono repository with `yarn`:

```bash
yarn init
```

Accept the default options and open up the project in your favorite text editor.

#### Enabling yarn workspaces

Yarn requires the `"private"` key to be set to `true` in `/package.json`, you can read more about why [here](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/#toc-how-to-use-it). Let's go ahead and make that change:

```json
{
  ...
  "private": true
  ...
}
```

---

## Creating our first workspace

We'll begin by setting up our Next.js application:

```bash
mkdir blog
cd blog
yarn init
```

When yarn prompts, accept the default options again and open up the `/blog/package.json` file that has been created, we'll need to change it's `"name"` property to enable it to be used in our mono repository:

```json
{
  ...
  "name": "@acme/blog"
  ...
}
```

We've changed the `"name"` property to `"@acme/blog"` where `@acme` refers to the package's [scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes). We'll use `@acme` as the scope for all of workspaces in this project.

> Feel free to rename `"@acme"` to whatever you like, but ensure that you use the same scope in the rest of the code from this post.

#### Telling yarn that we've got a workspace

Yarn will read the `"workspaces"` key in the top-level `/package.json` file in your project to lookup workspaces. Let's go ahead and add our new workspace:

```json
{
  ...
  "workspaces": ["blog"]
  ...
}
```

> ⚠️ We tell yarn where to find our workspace in the directory structure rather than what the workspace "name" is.

We'll pick up workspaces again in a bit.

---

## Building our blog application

Now workspaces are set up, we're ready to start building our our blog application. Make sure your current working directory is `blog` and add the following dependencies:

```bash
yarn add next
yarn add react
yarn add react-dom
yarn add @zeit/next-typescript
yarn add typescript
yarn add @types/next
yarn add @types/react
yarn add @types/react-dom
```

> ⚠️ Once these have finished, yarn will create a `yarn.lock` file at the root of the repository. If this hasn't happened, or the `yarn.lock` file is somewhere else in the directory structure, something has gone wrong!

#### Setting up development scripts

Let's add a couple of scripts to `/blog/package.json` to allow us to develop the application:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next",
    "build": "next build"
  }
  ...
}
```

> If you run `yarn dev` now you'll see the error "Couldn't find a `pages` directory. Please create one under the project root".

#### Creating an index page

Next's router will serve the default exported React component in `/pages/index` when visiting the application's `/` route. Create and write the following to `/blog/pages/index.tsx`:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { NextStatelessComponent } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";

interface Props {
  posts: any[];
}

const BlogIndex: NextStatelessComponent<Props> = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Acme's blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link passHref href={`/${post.id}`}>
              <a>{post.title}</a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

BlogIndex.getInitialProps = async () => {
  const posts = [
    { id: 1, title: "10 great drinking games" },
    { id: 2, title: "3 amazing hangover antidotes!" }
  ];
  return { posts };
};

export default BlogIndex;
```

> For now, we've used hard-coded data, an any type and simple HTML elements for the design. However, we'll replace these when we build our API and shared component library later.

Go ahead and run the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

😕 We've got a `404` but we were expecting our post listing... What's up?

## TypeScript, babel, next, oh my!

So Next.js has an issue picking up the `index.tsx` file we just made. Clearly there's some work to be done.

#### Configuring TypeScript

We've already installed `TypeScript` in our `blog` workspace, but we haven't created a configuration file yet. We'll be writing our other workspaces in TypeScript as well and it would be nice to share a base configuration so let's create a root level `/tsconfig.json` with the following:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "esnext",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "noEmit": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "sourceMap": true,
    "target": "esnext"
  }
}
```

> This TypeScript configuration will be shared between all of our workspaces.

Now we can extend it in `/blog/tsconfig.json` workspace:

```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "preserve",
    "lib": ["dom", "es2017"]
  }
}
```

> This TypeScript configuration will extend the base configuration with specific configuration for our blog project.

#### Transpiling via babel

In order to transpile the TypeScript, we need to create a `/babel.config.js` file.

Make a `babel.config.js` file at the root of the repository so that it is shared between our `blog` workspace and the other workspaces we'll be making later in the post:

```javascript
module.exports = function(api) {
  api.cache(true);

  const presets = [
    "next/babel",
    ["@babel/preset-typescript", { isTSX: true, allExtensions: true }]
  ];

  const plugins = [];

  return {
    presets,
    plugins
  };
};
```

> If you're wondering why we're not using a `.babelrc` file - the `babel.config.js` is intended to be shared across projects, you can read more about the `babel.config.js` file [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration#what-s-your-use-case).

#### Letting Next.js know what we've done

Lastly, let's tie everything together via `/blog/next.config.js`:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const withTypeScript = require("@zeit/next-typescript");
const withCustomBabelConfigFile = require("next-plugin-custom-babel-config");

module.exports = withCustomBabelConfigFile(
  withTypeScript({
    babelConfigFile: path.resolve("../babel.config.js")
  })
);
```

We've introduced a new dependency `next-plugin-custom-babel-config`, and we need to install it. Ensure you're in the `blog` directory and run:

```bash
yarn add next-plugin-custom-babel-config
```

This plugin is required to [monkey patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) `next-babel-loader` to use our shared `babel.config.js` file.

#### And...

First milestone done and dusted! 🎉🎉🎉

```bash
yarn dev
```

## On to the API workspace

We've successfully set up a simple Next.js application workspace written in TypeScript that uses a shared `babel.config.js` and inherits a shared `tsconfig.json` file, but we've hard-coded the list of posts. Let's fix that by creating a simple API to serve us a list of blog posts.

#### Setting up the workspace

We've been here before, but for completeness ensure your current working directory is the root of the project and run the following:

```bash
mkdir api
cd api
yarn init
```

Accept the defaults and modify the generated `/api/package.json` to rename the package again:

```json
{
  ...
  "name": "@acme/api"
  ...
}
```

Lastly, update the root `/package.json` to reflect the addition of our new workspace:

```json
{
  ...
  "workspaces": [
    "blog",
    "api"
  ]
  ...
}
```

#### Installing dependencies we'll need

It's outside the scope of this post to create a fully-fledged back-end for a blog website, however we'll simulate one using a combination of [faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) and [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express). Ensure your current working directory is `api` and run the following:

```bash
yarn add faker
yarn add express
yarn add typescript
yarn add ts-node
yarn add @types/faker
yarn add @types/express
```

#### Adding TypeScript

Similar to the blog workspace, add TypeScript configuration to our API workspace via `/api/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs"
  }
}
```

> Note that we set `"module"` to `"commonjs"` for `ts-node`

#### Creating the API

We'll only need a single `/api/index.ts` file for our simple fake API:

```typescript
import * as express from "express";
import * as faker from "faker";

export namespace Models {
  export interface Post {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    content: string;
  }
}

function randomPost(): Models.Post {
  return {
    id: faker.random.uuid(),
    title: faker.lorem.sentence(),
    content: faker.lorem.paragraphs()
  };
}

const app = express();

app.get("/posts", (_req, res) => {
  const posts: Models.Post[] = Array.from({ length: 10 }).map(randomPost);
  res.json(posts);
});

app.listen(5000);

console.log("API started on port 5000");
```

> The `Models` namespace of types is exported so that we can type other workspaces that consume the API.

#### Setting up scripts

Lastly we'll create a script in `/api/package.json` to start the API:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "ts-node ./index.ts"
  },
  ...
}
```

Go ahead and run the app:

```bash
yarn start
```

Visit [http://localhost:5000/posts](http://localhost:5000/posts) to see a listing of random blog posts.

#### API client library

In order to keep the interface between the blog application and the API consistent, we'll create a simple API client library implemented in TypeScript that the blog application can import and use to make requests to the API.

Firstly, add `axios` to the `api` workspace:

```bash
yarn add axios
```

Create `/api/client.ts` and write the following to it:

```typescript
import axios from "axios";
import { Models } from ".";

const baseURL = "http://localhost:5000";

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL
});

export const apiClient = {
  posts: {
    async getListing(): Promise<Models.Post[]> {
      const { data } = await instance.get("/posts");
      return data;
    }
  }
};
```

---

## Back to the blog app

Now that the API is finished, let's update the blog to use the API client we just made.

Since this is the first time we've used a workspace within another workspace, we need to make a small adjustment to the `/blog/package.json` file to tell yarn that we wish to use the API workspace:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@acme/api": "*"
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Now that's out of the way, open up `/blog/index.tsx` and make the following adjustments:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { NextStatelessComponent } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";
import { Models } from "@acme/api";
import { apiClient } from "@acme/api/client";

interface Props {
  posts: Models.Post[];
}

const BlogIndex: NextStatelessComponent<Props> = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Acme's blog</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link passHref href={`/${post.id}`}>
              <a>{post.title}</a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

BlogIndex.getInitialProps = async () => {
  const posts = await apiClient.posts.getListing();
  return { posts };
};

export default BlogIndex;
```

Keep the API running in one terminal, and open up another in the `/blog` directory and run the app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to inspect our API-driven blog.

😕 We've got another error... What's up now!?

---

## Workspace transpilation

Up till now, we've set up Babel to transpile the TypeScript in our workspaces via a root level `/babel.config.js`, but Babel ignores `node_modules` by default. The blog workspace needs to transpile the the `@acme/api` workspace (which resides as a symlink in the root level `/node_modules/@acme/api`).

Luckily for us, there's another Next.js plugin we can use called [next-plugin-transpile-modules](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-plugin-transpile-modules) that we can take advantage of to add transpilation of specific `node_modules`. Let's install it from the `/blog` directory:

```bash
yarn add next-plugin-transpile-modules
```

And update `/blog/next.config.js` to use the plugin:

```javascript
const path = require("path");
const withTypescript = require("@zeit/next-typescript");
const withCustomBabelConfigFile = require("next-plugin-custom-babel-config");
const withTranspileModules = require("next-plugin-transpile-modules");

module.exports = withCustomBabelConfigFile(
  withTranspileModules(
    withTypescript({
      babelConfigFile: path.resolve("../babel.config.js"),
      transpileModules: ["@acme"]
    })
  )
);
```

The `transpileModules` key is set to `["@acme"]` which instructs Babel to transpile any modules with the scope `@acme`. This is great because it means that if we add any other workspaces, we only need to add them to `package.json` to be able to use them right away. If you prefer to be verbose, you can list out the full package names in an array instead.

#### And...

Another milestone covered! 🎉🎉🎉

Go ahead and restart the blog application and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## On to the design workspace

By now, we've covered everything you need to set up a mono repository with Next.js, TypeScript and yarn workspaces, however I promised a shared component library and I'm true to my word 😉

#### We've been here before

Create the design workspace:

```bash
mkdir design
cd design
yarn init
```

Update `/design/package.json` to scope the package:

```json
{
  ...
  "name": "@acme/design"
  ...
}
```

Update the root `/package.json`'s workspaces:

```json
{
  ...
  "workspaces": [
    "blog",
    "api",
    "design"
  ]
  ...
}
```

Add dependencies:

```bash
yarn add react
yarn add react-dom
yarn add typescript
yarn add styled-components
yarn add @types/react
yarn add @types/react-dom
yarn add @types/styled-components
```

Configure TypeScript via `/design/tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react"
  }
}
```

And we're good to go.

---

## Creating the component library

For simplicity, we'll create a single `/design/components.tsx` file that exports some React components built with styled components:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import styled from "styled-components";

const Heading = styled.h1`
  font-size: 2rem;
  line-height: 2.4rem;
  margin: 0 0 1rem;
`;

const Main = styled.main`
  padding: 1rem;
`;

export function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <Main>
      <Heading>Acme's blog</Heading>
      {children}
    </Main>
  );
}
```

## Update blog

Now we're ready to start using the components we've made inside the blog workspace. Firstly, update `/blog/package.json` to include the new workspace as a dependency:

```json
{
  ...
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "@acme/api": "*",
    "@acme/design": "*"
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Now, update `/blog/pages/index.tsx` to use the `Layout` component:

```typescript
import * as React from "react";
import { NextStatelessComponent } from "next";
import Link from "next/link";
import { Models } from "@acme/api/server";
import { apiClient } from "@acme/api/client";
import { Layout } from "@acme/design/components";

interface Props {
  posts: Models.Post[];
}

const BlogIndex: NextStatelessComponent<Props> = ({ posts }) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <ul>
        {posts.map(post => (
          <li key={post.id}>
            <Link passHref href={`/${post.id}`}>
              <a>{post.title}</a>
            </Link>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </Layout>
  );
};

BlogIndex.getInitialProps = async () => {
  const posts = await apiClient.posts.getListing();
  return { posts };
};

export default BlogIndex;
```

---

## Hot reloading

We're not quite done yet! If you run the development server inside the `blog` application and make a change to a component in the `design` workspace, hot reloading does not work. The reason for this is that Webpack does not expose a configuration option for resolving symlinks to their full path, which means that changes inside the source directory do not trigger a reload in WebpackDevServer. You can read more in [this issue](https://github.com/webpack/watchpack/issues/61).

To fix this, we'll add a _super hacky_ `postinstall` script in our root level `package.json` file:

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "sed -i 's/followSymlinks: false/followSymlinks: true/g' node_modules/watchpack/lib/DirectoryWatcher.js"
  }
  ...
}
```

> 🤮 Yuck!
