A colleague of mine showed me a neat little unknown feature of Typescript in combination with React that makes it a delight to achieve type-safe generic React components.

## Generic React components

Generic React components are components that take in a [generic data shape](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) and expose props that operate upon that data shape. For example, a carousel component that takes in an array of a data and exposes a [render-prop](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) to render each slide within the carousel:

```tsx
// slider.tsx
import React from 'react'

interface Props {
  slides: any[]
  renderSlide: (slide: any): React.ReactNode
}

export function Slider(props: Props) {
  return (
    <SliderContainer>
      <LeftArrow />
      {props.slides.map((slide, i) => (
        <SlideContainer key={i}>
          {props.renderSlide(slide)}
        </SlideContainer>
      ))}
      <RightArrow />
    </SliderContainer>
  )
}

// app.tsx
interface Cat {
  name: string,
  image: string
}

const cats: Cat[] = [
  { name: 'Cute cat', image: 'cute-cat.png' },
  { name: 'Evil cat', image: 'evil-cat.png' }
]

export default () {
  return (
    <Slider
      slides={cats}
      renderSlide={cat => (
        <div>
          <img src={cat.image} />
          <h2>{cat.name}</h2>
        </div>
      )}
    />
  )
}
```

The example above is perfectly fine however, you'll notice that the component's `slides` and `renderSlide` props are typed using `any`. This means that when using the component, there will be no inferred type in the render prop `renderSlide` even though we know ahead of time what the data shape of `slides` is. However, we can do better!

## Adding type safety

It's clear that the `<Slider />` component is designed to be flexible enough to work with varying data shapes, however it does not provide any mechanism for ensuring that the `renderSlide` prop is type-safe in combination with it's `slides` prop. For those who are well versed with Typescript, you'll know that [generics](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html) are the missing ingredient. For those who don't know, generics allow us to pass around information about the type of data a function, class, or in this case, component is dealing with.

We can change our `<Slider />` component to take a generic type argument:

```tsx
// slider.tsx
import React from 'react'

interface Props<T> {
  slides: T[]
  renderSlide: (slide: T): React.ReactNode
}

export function Slider<T>(props: Props<T>) {
  return (
    <SliderContainer>
      <LeftArrow />
      {props.slides.map((slide, i) => (
        <SlideContainer key={i}>
          {props.renderSlide(slide)}
        </SlideContainer>
      ))}
      <RightArrow />
    </SliderContainer>
  )
}
```

> Adding a generic type argument `<T>` and passing it to the `Props` interface allows the data shape to be passed around

Now it's set up, let's explore how this can be used in our app.

## A nieve approach

```tsx
// app.tsx
interface Cat {
  name: string,
  image: string
}

const cats: Cat[] = [
  { name: 'Cute cat', image: 'cute-cat.png' },
  { name: 'Evil cat', image: 'evil-cat.png }
]

const CatSlider = Slider<Cat>

export default () {
  return (
    <CatSlider
      slides={cats}
      renderSlide={cat => (
        <div>
          <img src={cat.image} />
          <h2>{cat.name}</h2>
        </div>
      )}
    />
  )
}
```

By assigning a new constant, `const CatSlider = Slider<Cat>`, we've passed the `Cat` interface to the `T` generic, and as a result, `renderSlide` is correctly typed as a `Cat` and immediately the application has become more type-safe. However, it feels a little hacky to assign a new constant to achieve this.

## A neat little trick

It would be much nicer if we didn't have to use an intermediary constant just to enable type-safety on our `CatSlider`. Well, a little known feature of Typescript with React allows us to pass generic type arguments directly in to React components:

```tsx
// app.tsx
interface Cat {
  name: string,
  image: string
}

const cats: Cat[] = [
  { name: 'Cute cat', image: 'cure-cat.png' },
  { name: 'Evil cat', image: 'evil-cat.png }
]

export default () {
  return (
    <Slider<Cat>
      slides={cats}
      renderSlide={cat => (
        <div>
          <img src={cat.image} />
          <h2>{cat.name}</h2>
        </div>
      )}
    />
  )
}
```

By passing the generic type argument inside the TSX via `<Slider<Cat> />` we can omit the intermediary constant. It looks a little weird but works a charm!
