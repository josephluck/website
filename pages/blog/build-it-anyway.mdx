# Build it anyway

If you've ever had an idea for a new side-project, the following scenario may be painfully familiar. You get a killer idea. You get inspired. You have all these amazing ideas. Your brain is racing. You pluck up the courage to start taking the idea seriously. You do some research. **You find out someone else has already built exactly what you intended to.**

I've been in this situation many times in the past, and it's so demotivating that I've given up on side-projects that I know for sure would have been really fun to build and really useful for myself and others. Maybe there's value in _building it anyway_ if we question _why_ we're building the side project in the first place.

The most recent reincarnation of this scenario I have played out in my mind is with a side-project that I've been building. However, I purposely _didn't_ research for competitor apps. The reason being? I wasn't building this app to start a business, competitors didn't matter. I questioned myself _why_ I'm building this side-project? I'm building it for learning and I'm building it for myself to use. Competitors aren't going to take away from those primary goals - I don't need to worry.

The side project is called [Internote](https://internote.app) and I'm having a lot of fun building and using it.

Even if you are starting a project with the intention of turning it in to a business one day? Well perhaps there's a reason you haven't heard of the competitor apps. Maybe your idea, if executed correctly will be superior? AltaVista was around 3 years before Google was incorporated...

**Build it anyway!**
