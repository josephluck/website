# Mettle

## The bank account built for the self-employed, by NatWest

I was hired at Mettle as a senior mobile engineer to build multiple products in cross-functional teams. I initially worked on our onboarding journey, a complicated series of screens with many possible user journeys depending on the nature of the customer's business and their personal information. I quickly identified a number of ways in which our proprietary state-machine could be simplified to facilitate developer experience, testing and faster iteration long term. To this day, new engineers joining the onboarding team have a much easier time getting up to speed with the architecture.

During my tenure I have held multiple positions including technical lead and senior engineer on the _Mettle Web App_ team where I led a cross-functional team of 6 engineers to build a brand new customer-facing web product from the ground up.

My major contribution as technical lead was operating in the boundaries of various departments within the organisation - security, architecture and infrastructure in particular. Since then I have taken many of the things that made the project successful and brought them to Mettle's older and more complex mobile codebase. For many of the larger pieces, I have utilised our RFC process to document, share and gather consensus.

I am the self-appointed technical lead on our _Design Systems_ working group where a dedicated engineers and designers are building a design system for our customer facing products. Some of my key achievements include introducing design tokens, theming, component architecture and visual testing.

A large amount of my effort is spent advocating for the benefits of design systems and how they benefit the customer, developer and facilitate quicker and safer product development. As technical lead of the working group I am directly responsible for the planning and execution of the project, often implementing many of the foundational parts of the design system myself.

As a Senior Software Engineer I have championed technical quality and led by example by utilising our RFC process extensively. Some key highlights include leading a codebase-wide migration from legacy FlowType to TypeScript, championing an output-driven testing strategy focusing with an emphasis on integration testing, improving our navigation architecture and defining a feature-based directory structure to better reflect areas of ownership.

I believe that a strong technical vision that is widely accepted and understood, with clear and manageable milestones is one of the best ways to maintain technical excellence in the long run. To this end, I keep my finger on the pulse of the wider technology ecosystem and advocate for graceful degradation of deprecated code/patterns, and often use proof-of-concepts to demonstrate new patterns/techniques that push us towards our vision.

As a technical leader, I am involved in our hiring loop. One of my strengths is code/architecture and I often lead our coding interviews. I have also onboarded many of our new hires and have acted as a mentor to a number of our more junior colleagues.

# Fantastec

## Leading digital collectibles for sports fans

I was hired at Fantastec as lead front-end engineer.

At the time, Fantastec was a brand-new start-up and my first responsibility was to define a front-end architecture that facilitated the rapid prototyping of multiple digital products.

Before I joined a contractor had started building Fantastec's first product, Game, using a proprietary framework. I made the difficult decision to make a case for scrapping this initial development in favour of open-source frameworks that would make it both easier to build products upon, and to hire engineers to work with. I did this by writing a technology strategy for the company, and used the strategy to point out the negative consequences that utilising a proprietary framework would result in. My work was well received by our CTO and I was able to define a robust architecture utilising TypeScript, React and Redux as core technologies.

During my time at Fantastec, I was also responsible for the hiring, onboarding and development of our front-end engineering team. My work here involved working with our CTO to define our ways of working, philosophy, hiring guides, recruitment partners and technical interviews. I personally interviewed every engineer at the company and helped onboard and mentor our more junior colleagues.

It was at Fantastec that I made the decision to utilise React Native as a technology for our mobile applications. At the time, React Native was in it's infancy and I spent a lot of time understanding the fundamental architecture that underpins it. I also up-skilled a number of engineers that had a web background to become proficient with our mobile stack. It was our mobile product that we secured investment to pursue and one of my key achievements was developing our CI/CD pipelines and release strategy.

Later in my tenure I worked closely with our head of product to define a long-term roadmap for our mobile product. This involved a comprehensive technical architecture roadmap that we could migrate our legacy back-end systems towards.

Whilst Fantastec was a small start-up working on greenfield projects, I learnt a lot about what it means to be a leader in a fast-paced and growing company.

# Goodlord

I was hired at Goodlord as a senior front-end engineer.

I joined Goodlord during a period of high growth. The company had just secured their series B funding and they were embarking on a project to replace their aging V1 product. I was one of the leading contributors to the re-architecture, building the majority of the customer-facing features myself. I also helped iterate on our front-end architecture and helped our CTO and other front-end engineers with a migration from Vue.js to React (to help with hiring).

Prior to Goodlord, I was a mid-level engineer and I had to quickly develop my fundamental software engineering skills. This meant expanding my understanding of back-end, architecture, security, monitoring, resilience and deployment. It was at Goodlord that I developed an appreciation for how good software architecture can enable teams to thrive, help new engineers onboard and produce an excellent customer experience. In particular, I learnt the benefits of functional programming and how functional patterns can lead to robust codebases that are easy to test and evolve.

Ultimately Goodlord failed to raise their series C funding and had to pivot to improving their existing V1 product. This was a very difficult time for the company, as a number of competent engineers, designers and product managers were let go. I was fortunate to retain my position and was tasked with splitting our (unfinished) V2 product in to multiple products that could be integrated in to the live V1 product. I did this by developing a front-end microservices architecture that allowed us to embed our V2 micro applications in to the legacy PHP monolith.
